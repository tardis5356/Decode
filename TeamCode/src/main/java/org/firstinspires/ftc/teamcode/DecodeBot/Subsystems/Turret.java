//TODO We need to check motor encoder to see if right goes in positive direction.
        //IMPORTANT NOTES ON TUNING PID. The P value can be seen as how fast the lift moves to reach a position. Start very
        //small and slowly increase it until the lift slightly oscillates around the desired location. Then, increase the D value,
        //also starting very small and slowly increasing. The D value determines how much the lift slows down as it approaches the desired value.
        //The I value is for accuracy. It takes how far off you are from your desired location and adds power to close that gap.
        //Its tuned in the same way as the other two values and should be done last after D.
